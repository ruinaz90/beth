# Beth
A collaboration to create a web scraper that takes recipes from Budget Bytes and generates an Excel file. Named after the author Beth.

## How It's Made
**Tech used:** Python

## Optimizations
The original application did not scrape multistep recipes and created blank tabs because of incorrect URLs. I updated the loops to associate each recipe name with a URL and write each recipe into a new worksheet in Excel.

## Lessons Learned
This project was helpful in understanding how to automate a task and learning how to use XlsxWriter to create Excel spreadsheets with proper formatting for a user to be able to use.
